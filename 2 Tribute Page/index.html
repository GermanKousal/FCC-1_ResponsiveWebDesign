      <h2>Here's a timeline of Turing's life:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><time datetime="1912-06-23">Jun 23, 1912</time>: Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida
          Vale,
          London.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1926-08-19">Aug 19, 1926</time>: At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of
          intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1931-08-29">Aug 29, 1931</time>: Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in
          Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1936-09-30">Sep 30, 1936</time>: Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also
          building
          three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1939-12-06">Dec 6, 1939</time>: Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German
          naval
          indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1940-03-18">Mar 18, 1940</time>: Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a
          cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1942-11-29">Nov 29, 1942</time>: Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US
          naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1946-02-19">Feb 19, 1946</time>: He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had
          presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1947-09-13">Sep 13, 1947</time>: Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design
          of
          the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).</li>
        <li><time datetime="1948-03-19">Mar 19, 1948</time>: Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used
          and
          is still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1948-08-31">Aug 31, 1948</time>: Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics
          department
          at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="1950-04-29">Apr 29, 1950</time>: The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was
          created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1952-01-29">Jan 29, 1952</time>: Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19
          year old man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the
          United Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1952-08-14">Aug 14, 1952</time>: Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was
          published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.</li>
        <li><time datetime="1954-06-08">Jun 8, 1954</time>: Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper
          found him dead.</li>
